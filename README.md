# Space Race Game

This is a (somewhat clone) of the 1973 Atari video game [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race_(video_game)).

It plays like a hybrid of Asteroids and Frogger.
It is a 2 player game where you need to get to the end as fast as you can within the time limit, without hitting the "stars"

I made this game in order to test out Deep Reinforcement Learning to see if an AI could play this game well!

## Installation

Pretty easy, just a simple pygame game for AI purposes.

Download and unzip the project, then run the python file.

If needed, install the (single) dependency: `pip install pygame`
