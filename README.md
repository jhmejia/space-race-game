# Space Race Game

This is a (somewhat clone) of the 1973 Atari video game [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race_(video_game)).

It plays like a hybrid of Asteroids and Frogger.
It is a 2 player game where you need to get to the end as fast as you can within the time limit, without hitting the "stars"

I made this game in order to test out Deep Reinforcement Learning to see if an AI could play this game well! I didn't want to copy someone elses one (theres already a lot of "ai plays pong" or "ai plays frogger". I couldn't even find a python version of space race so this will do.)

## Installation

Pretty easy, just a simple pygame game for AI purposes.

Download and unzip the project, then run the python file: `py spacerace.py`.

If needed, install the (single) dependency: `pip install pygame`
NOTE: as of Jan 2023 pygame does not work on python 3.11. If you are having issues with pygame ty going to python 3.10.

You can also edit the settings through the constants part if you really want to (self explanatory):
